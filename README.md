# gs-postman-Request-Promise-Native



# Deprecated!

As of Feb 11th 2020, [`request`](https://github.com/request/request) is fully deprecated. No new changes are expected to land. In fact, none have landed for some time. This package is also deprecated because it depends on `request`.

Fyi, here is the [reasoning of `request`'s deprecation](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142) and a [list of alternative libraries](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143).

---

This package is similar to [`request-promise-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise-native) but uses fork  [postman request js](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-reques) native ES6+ promises.


## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

```
npm install --save postman-request
npm install --save gs-postman-request-promise-native
```

`request` is defined as a peer-dependency and thus has to be installed separately.

## License (ISC)

In case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.

See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.
